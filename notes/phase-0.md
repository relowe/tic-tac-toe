Phase 0 - Initial Commit
========================
This phase is just to get things going.  I've brought in a skeleton of
an FLTK Makefile that I like to use. This also includes the basic
GitHub support files (license, README.md, etc.)

The .gitgnore file is a simple one that tries to avoid capturing
binary files and common backup files.
