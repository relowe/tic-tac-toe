Phase 2 - Tic-Tac-Toe Model
===========================
In this phase, we create a simple object which represents
a tic-tac-toe board.  This board also contains functions for making
perfect moves via the minimax algorithm.

For more information on minimax, please see the wikipedia article:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax

This also includes a little test program "boardtest" which is built by
the makefile.  This will play an index based version of tic-tac-toe,
but without rendering the board.  The indexes are as follows:
```c++
//      0 | 1 | 2
//     ---+---+---
//      3 | 4 | 5
//     ---+---+---
//      6 | 7 | 8
```

Play boardtest a bit and take a look at the results!  (you'll want to
draw the tic-tac-toe board by hand while playing.)

In the next phase, we will put the two things together.
